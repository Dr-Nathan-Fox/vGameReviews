## steamReviews

The goal of this R package is to provide an accessible method for
returning reviews from the Steam API into the R environment.

## Issues and bugs

This package requires an internet connection as well as a connection to
the Steam API, which may not be constantly available.

If you discover a bug not associated with connection to the API that is
not already a [reported
issue](https://github.com/nfox29/steamReviews/issues), please [open a
new issue](https://github.com/nfox29/steamReviews/issues/new) providing
a reproducible example.
